Description: 	Number guessing game where you try to guess a randomly generated 
		5 cipher number in the shortest amount of tries.
Prerequesits:	Python
Output:		If your attempt is saved and no scoreboard exists it will generate a 
		scoreboard in a file called scoreboard.txt to save scores locally.

Use:		The game will generate a pseudo random 5 cipher number and you will
		try to guess it in the shortest amount of tries. After an attempt
		you will see the amount of "hits" (Number is correct and in the
		right place), and how many "matches" (Number is correct, but in the
		wrong place). The game is won when you have all numbers in the right
		place.
